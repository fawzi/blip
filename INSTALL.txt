NArray a multidimensional array in D.

Git repositories is available at
    http://github.com/fawzi/

You need to take both rtest (the testing framework and basic utils) and narray (the actual multidimensional array library).
If you have git you can

    git clone git://github.com/fawzi/blip.git

to install

    cd blip
    dsss build
    dsss install
    cd ..
    
if you want to use blas/lapack you need the blas/lapack wrappers from multiarray/gobo
http://dsource.org/projects/multiarray

to activate it you need
    -version=blas       // activates blas calling in dot product
    -version=lapack     // activates lapack derived LinAlg routines (solve,eig,eigh,svd,...)

other useful flags are
    -debug=TestNArray   // activates extra internal consistency checks in NArray
    -version=multiarray // in perf_test times also multiarray performace (that you need to install separately)

To have maximum speed compile with -release -O, but as it is quite new you might want to first compile it with checks.

The code has a comprehensive battery of test. The tests in testNArray are quite stringent,
and with random generation they might be numerically difficult.
I did not want to reduce too much the accuracy of the tests, and so in some cases they might fail 
(especially without blas, or with very agressive blas), it this is the case look at the error that 
they have, probably everything is still ok.
On windows there is a limit on the number of symbols that can be defined in a single file, testNArray with all tests would exceed this limit, so by default only the tests for double argument are performed, if you want other you have to activate them by hand.

To test there are test executables, or one can also 
    dsss build -debug=UnitTest -g --test

have fun!
