Blip is undergoing a reorganization, so building might be a little more complex than it should:
 * you need the trunk of tango to build blip (or the older frozen version http://github.com/fawzi/oldTango ), the next release of tango will be supported. There are useful scripts to build tango trunk in the buildTango directory. They assume that the runtime directory is called libtango-base-dmd.a or libtango-base-ldc.a, edit your dmd.conf/ldc.cof file accordingly (-defaultlib=libtango-base-xxx.a -debuglib=libtango-base-xxx.a), and remember to add tango and tango/core/vendor to the search path of the compiler.
 * you need hwloc 1.x from http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/
 * you need libev 3.6 from http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html
 * blas/lapack is required (and used for NArray operations) by default the Accelerate framework is used on mac, and MKL library on linux (just define MKL_ROOT to use it).
If you want to avoid installing it add "-version=no_blas -version=no_lapack" to the DFLAGS_COMP of your platform in the build/arch directory

For blip itself, the git repository is available at
    http://github.com/fawzi/

If you have git you can

    git clone git://github.com/fawzi/blip.git

to install
    cd blip
    ./build.sh
    cd ..

this should build the blip library, and the test programs (in lib and exe)
see ./build.sh --help for help with the flags of the build script
to compile your programs if you use xfbuild you can try to use the dbuild script (that automatically links all the needed stuff).

mpi has wrappers to the open mpi routines, but that has to be activated (has been tested with openmpi).

The code has a comprehensive battery of test.
By default all of them are built, which especially for testNArray might take some time, 
if you don't want to build them use lib as target.
The tests in testNArray are quite stringent, and with random generation they might be 
numerically difficult.
I did not want to reduce too much the accuracy of the tests, and so in some cases they 
might fail (especially for single precision without blas, or with a very agressive blas),
it this is the case look at the error that they have, probably everything is still ok.
On windows there is a limit on the number of symbols that can be defined in a single file, 
testNArray with all tests would exceed this limit, so by default only the tests for double 
argument are performed, if you want other you have to activate them by hand.

have fun!
