Blip is undergoing a reorganization, so building might be a little more complex than it should:
* you need the trunk of tango to build blip (or the older frozen version http://github.com/fawzi/oldTango ), the next release of tango will be supported
* 
Git repositories is available at
    http://github.com/fawzi/

If you have git you can

    git clone git://github.com/fawzi/blip.git

to install
    cd tango/build
    ./build.sh
    cd ../..
    
    cd blip
    ./build.sh
    cd ..
    
blas/lapack wrappers are used by default, and are part of the distribution, they come from the 
    http://dsource.org/projects/multiarray
project, but the blas and lapack library themselves have to be installed by yourself (mkl is a good choice, some versions of goto2 have a threading problem)

you can also use the included makefile, for example on mac I do

  make EXTRA_LIBS="-L=-ltango-user-ldc -L=-framework -L=Accelerate" TANGO_HOME=$HOME/d/tango

to deactivate them you need
    -version=no_blas       // deactivates blas calling in dot product
    -version=no_lapack     // deactivates lapack derived LinAlg routines (solve,eig,eigh,svd,...)

so if you do not want to link blas/lapack do something like

  make EXTRA_LIBS="-L=-ltango-user-ldc" DFLAGS_ADD="-d-version=no_lapack \
    -d-version=no_blas" TANGO_HOME=$HOME/d/tango

other useful flags are
    -debug=TestNArray   // activates extra internal consistency checks in NArray
    -version=multiarray // in perf_test times also multiarray performace (that you need to install separately)

mpi has wrappers to the open mpi routines, but that has to be activated (openmpi is a good choice).

To have maximum speed compile with -release -O, but as it is quite new you might want to 
first compile it with checks.

The code has a comprehensive battery of test.
By default all of them are built, which especially for testNArray might take some time, 
if you don't want to build them use lib as target.
The tests in testNArray are quite stringent, and with random generation they might be 
numerically difficult.
I did not want to reduce too much the accuracy of the tests, and so in some cases they 
might fail (especially for single precision without blas, or with a very agressive blas),
it this is the case look at the error that they have, probably everything is still ok.
On windows there is a limit on the number of symbols that can be defined in a single file, 
testNArray with all tests would exceed this limit, so by default only the tests for double 
argument are performed, if you want other you have to activate them by hand.

have fun!
