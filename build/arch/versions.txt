Version and debug flags

Debugging a parallel program can be really hard, sometime some logging might be the best
solution to find an error. Here is the list of debug and version flags.

parallel.smp
# version DetailedLog: details log of task execution start/end...
# debug TrackQueues: tracks queues in the tasks
# version noReuse: avoid reusing Tasks, PriQSchedulers & co
# debug TrackTasks: follows the tasks
# debug TrackFibers: tracks fibers in the pools and tasks
# version TrackCollections: tracks collections of PriQSchedulers and Tasks
# version NoPLoops: deactivates PLoops (makes them sequential)
# debug TrackDelayFlags: shows changes in the delay flags

container
# debug SafeDeque: avoid using memove & co in Deque
# debug TrackPools: tracks the pools

serialization
# version UnserializationTrace: tracks unserialization
# version SerializationTrace: tracks serialization

io
# version TrackBInReadSome: prints out buffer in read some
# version TrackEvents: tracks libev events
# version SocketEcho: echoes writes and reads from BasicSockets
# version TrackSocketServer: prints out listining, accept,... of Socket server

rpc
# version TrackRpc: tracks remote procedure calls
# version StcpTextualSerialization: uses Json serializer for the data sent though stcp (instead of Sbin) 
# version StcpNoCache: does not use cache 
# version TrackStcpRequests: writes out creation, destruction, transfer to pool of StcpRequests

tests
# version NoLog: removes logging from EchoServer and StressEchoServer

narray
# version no_blas: does not use blas bindings
# version CBlasDot: uses cblas for dot operations (returning values from fortran does not work reliably)
# version BlasRotm: activates the modified Givens rotations (not defined in some blas versions)
# version no_lapack: does not use lapack bindings (deativates several functions)
